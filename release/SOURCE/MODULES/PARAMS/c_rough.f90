MODULE c_rough

  IMPLICIT NONE

! Z0FSEA = roughness length for free convective heat and moisture
!          transport over the sea (m).
!          DUMMY VARIABLE - Only used in 7A boundary layer scheme
! Z0HSEA = roughness length for heat and moisture transport
!          over the sea (m).
! Z0MIZ  = roughness length for heat, moisture and momentum over
!          the Marginal Ice Zone (m).
! Z0SICE = roughness length for heat, moisture and momentum over
!          sea-ice (m).

  REAL, PARAMETER :: z0hsea = 4.0e-5
  REAL, PARAMETER :: z0miz  = 1.0e-1
