! Module for picking up BL, and other, options

! Description:
!   Permissible settings for BL options.
!   This module replaces blopt8a.h for settings required by land surface.
!   It also includes variables from bl_options_mod, bl_diags_mod 
!   and swapable_field_mod

! Code Description:
!   Language: FORTRAN 90
!   This code is written to UMDP3 v8.2 programming standards.

MODULE blopt8a

    IMPLICIT NONE

#include "blopt8a.h"

!---------------------------------------------------------------
! Duplicating later BL options from bl_options_mod
! for use in the standalone JULES code.

!                      !   gustiness is considered (oiginal version)

!                      !   due to boundary layer eddies is reduced
!                      !   relative to the above, but eddies driven
!                      !   by convective downdraughts are included
  REAL :: Max_Stress_Grad = 0.05
!                      ! Maximum implied stress gradient across the 
!                      ! boundary layer, used to limit the explicit 
!                      ! stress applied in non-local scalings (m/s2)
